**Requirements**:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Overview
Contains [CKAN spatial images](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker-spatial/pkgs/container/ckan-base-spatial) for the different components of CKAN Cloud and a [Docker compose spatial environment](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker) for development and testing Open Data portals.

>**Warning**:<br>
>This is a **custom base images of CKAN** with specific extensions for spatial data. For the official Git Repo, please have a look: [Pre-configured CKAN Docker images](https://github.com/ckan/ckan-docker-base).

# Pre-configured CKAN Docker images

The images will usually be used as a Docker Compose install in conjunction with other Docker images that make up the CKAN platform. 

The following CKAN versions are available at this repo:

| CKAN Version | Type | Docker tag | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.9.9-dev | custom image | `ghcr.io/mjanez/ckan-base-spatial:ckan-2.9.9-dev` | Includes dependencies for spatial capabilities. Compatible with ckanext-spatial. Development image. |
| 2.9.9 | custom image | `ghcr.io/mjanez/ckan-base-spatial:ckan-2.9.9` | Includes dependencies for spatial capabilities. Compatible with ckanext-spatial. |
| master | custom image | `ghcr.io/mjanez/ckan-base-spatial:master` | Latest version. Includes dependencies for spatial capabilities. Compatible with ckanext-spatial. |

>**Note**<br>
>The custom CKAN Docker installation (with spatial extensions) can be found here: [`mjanez/ckan-docker`](https://github.com/mjanez/ckan-docker)

### Building and Pushing the images

The images can be built locally and tagged appropriately.


### Scanning the images for vulnerabilites

<to do - provide details on the process of how we scan images - probably using [Synk Advisor](https://docs.docker.com/develop/scan-images/)>
